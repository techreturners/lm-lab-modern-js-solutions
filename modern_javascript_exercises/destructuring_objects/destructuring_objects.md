# Destructuring Objects

The `introduction()` function uses Object Dot Notation to access different properties on the person object.

This is ok - but it's quite long!

Can you use Object Destructuring to save a bit of code?

To run the tests:

            npm test destructuring_objects.test.js

Hint: make sure you're in the correct folder before running this command
