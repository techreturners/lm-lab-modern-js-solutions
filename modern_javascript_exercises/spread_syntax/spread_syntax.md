# Spread Syntax

The function `allTheNumbers()` currently returns an empty array.

Using Spread Syntax, update the `allTheNumbers()` function so it returns an array of all the numbers and fix the failing test.

To run the test:

            npm test spread_syntax.test.js

Hint: make sure you're in the correct folder before running this command 👍
