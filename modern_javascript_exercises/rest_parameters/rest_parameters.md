# Rest Parameters

The `add()` function in `rest_parameters.js` adds two numbers together.

This is fine... but what if we wanted to add any number of arguments? ðŸ¤”

If you run this file using:

                node rest_parameters.js

You'll notice that numbers 3, 4 and 5 are getting ignored.

Using Rest Parameters and some kind of forLoop (your choice!), refactor this function so that it can add together any

number of arguments and fix the failing test.

To run the tests:

            npm test rest_parameters.test.js

Hint: make sure you're in the correct folder before running these commands. You will also need to `console.log()` your function to see any output.

Good luck! ðŸ™Œ
