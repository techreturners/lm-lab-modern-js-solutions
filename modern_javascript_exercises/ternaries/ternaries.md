# Ternary Operator

The `sayHello()` function is using an if/else conditional statement.

To save some code, replace the if/else statement with a ternary operator instead.

Whatever you do, make sure the tests still pass! ğŸ‘®

To run the tests:

            npm test ternaries.test.js

Hint: make sure you're in the correct folder before running these commands.
