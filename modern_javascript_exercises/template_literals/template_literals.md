# Template Literals

The `greeting()` function returns a string with variables in it using string addition (sometimes called string "interpolation")

But there is another, more modern way to concatenate strings with variables in them...

Using Template Literals! ðŸ¥³

Can you refactor this function so it returns the string using a template literal?

To run the tests:

            npm test template_literals.test.js

Hint: make sure you're in the correct folder before running these commands.
