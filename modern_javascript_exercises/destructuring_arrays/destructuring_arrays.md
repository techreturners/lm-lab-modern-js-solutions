# Destructuring Arrays

In the `sequence()` function, array properties are accessed using bracket notation, and stored in variables.

These variables are then returned.

Using "Destructuring", can you refactor the code `sequence()` function so it uses less code?

To run the tests:

            npm test destructuring_arrays.test.js

Hint: make sure you're in the correct folder before running this command
